  Dependencies: 

      gcc compiler, xinput

  Usage:

   To start the Keylogger

      $bash start.sh

   To stop  the keylogger

      $bash stop.sh

   To explore the result

      $cat keyStrokes.txt


Caution: DO NOT open 'keyStrokes.txt' unless 'stop.sh' is executed as the file is being written.

A daemon process is generated right after executing 'start.sh'. So one can even quit the terminal.

Happy BASHing...
