  Dependencies: 

      gcc compiler, xinput

  Usage:

   To start the Keylogger

      $bash start.sh

   To stop  the keylogger

      $bash stop.sh

   To explore the result

      $cat keyStrokes.txt


Caution: DO NOT open 'keyStrokes.txt' unless 'stop.sh' is executed, since the file is being written.

A daemon process is generated right after executing 'start.sh'. So one can even quit the terminal. 
The daemon process gets terminated only when executing 'stop.sh' or generating the signal 'SIGINT' manually.

Happy BASHing...
