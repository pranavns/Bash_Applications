when carried out manually. This would be useful when you want to make a result in a short span of time.     
													      
Some of these scripts may have dependencies which can even be a third-party application in Ubuntu SC.        
As this is available as open source one can easily customize these scripts to their own version and support. 
                                                                                                             
My intention is to introduce the possibilites of shell scripting with productive outcome.                    
Shell scripting is used as a powerful tool for ethical hacking and penetration testing.                      
                                                                                                             
Instructions for those who are not familiar with shell scripting:                                            
                                                                                                             
        1. Open the terminal (CTRL+ALT+T)                                                                    
        2. Create the shell file (.sh extention is convinient to identify script files)                      
        3. Give permissions to make it executable                                                            
           $ chmod +x <file.sh>
